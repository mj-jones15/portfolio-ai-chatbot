After I returned home from studying abroad in Bilbao, Spain. June, 2025
    Súper guay. The only words I have to describe my incredible experience the last few months as I studied abroad in Bilbao, Spain and traveled all around southern Europe.

    Thanks to University of Deusto, immersive spanish classes revolving around local Basque and Spanish culture allowed me to dive deep into spanish history while their college of engineering kept me on track with my computer science degree. I especially appreciated the opportunity to learn about the Basque people and their traditions. This dynamic also gave me the opportunity to experience learning in a different culture, where classes are more hands on rather than lecture based. 

    Likewise, Genoveva García-Gallardo and International Studies Abroad (ISA) were some of the best hosts ever, connecting me with an incredible host family and showing off everything that Bilbao has to offer. My host family helped me practice my spanish to a near fluent level, and the cultural experiences ranged from peace museums to beret factories, showing a side of Spain I may have struggled to find on my own. I am so fortunate to have had this opportunity, and look forward to the rest of my life with these newly improved skills of independence and perseverance.
