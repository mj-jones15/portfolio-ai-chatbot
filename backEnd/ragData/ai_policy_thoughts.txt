AI-Policy
As a young student, I recognize that I am still developing my core beliefs about the direction U.S. legislation should take regarding artificial intelligence. However, I deeply admire the comprehensive approach to AI regulation adopted by the European Union and would strongly support the creation of a similar task force in Washingtonâ€”especially in light of the dissolution of the original U.S. AI task force. I believe that assembling a team of leading experts with access to the latest research and technological insights is essential to crafting legislation that proactively addresses critical issues such as AI safety, intellectual property, national security, and defense.
