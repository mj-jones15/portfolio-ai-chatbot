This was my short paragraph essay to be accepted into Tau Beta Pi, an engineering honor society, at the University of Kentucky.

I am conﬁdent in my ability to be a valuable member of Tau Beta Pi through my integrity,
diverse interests, and commitment to community service. Within the University of
Kentucky’s Computer Science department, I work as an AI Researcher for the Center of
Computational Sciences and am pursuing an AI certiﬁcate to deepen my expertise.
Outside my department, I actively participate in the UK Men’s Choir and the acoUstiKats,
UK’s premier male a cappella group. My love for music has further motivated me to pursue
a minor in vocal performance, exemplifying my commitment to exploring interests beyond
engineering. In terms of personal integrity, I am a diligent and honest student, maintaining
my grades through proactive preparation rather than shortcuts. My dedication to
volunteerism has been consistent as well; I’ve contributed on the tech team at my church,
coached youth basketball, and volunteered at local libraries. Ultimately, these experiences
reﬂect my adaptability, diverse interests, and desire to serve others- qualities of an ideal
candidate for Tau Beta Pi.
