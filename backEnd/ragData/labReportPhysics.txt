Lab # 7: Calcula,ng Spring Constants with Uncertain,es
Researcher: Sam Jordan
Coder: Noah Cunningham-O’Donnell
Notetaker: Ma=hew Jones
Introduc)on: Sam Jordan (R)
The purpose of this experiment was to see which method or equa;on (CBR, equa;on 2, or
equa;on 5) yields the least amount of systema;c uncertainty. This was determined by
examining which method or equa;on provides the most consistent k constant value. Systema;c
uncertainty refers to a type of uncertainty that arises from ﬂaws in the experimental design,
equipment, or procedures used. This diﬀers from random uncertainty in a way that does not
include human error. Mul;ple methods and equa;ons were used in order to eliminate
systema;c uncertainty. Based on our ﬁndings, equa;on 51 provided the most consistent results
by carrying out numerous trials, thus leading us to believe that equa;on 5 eliminates the most
amount of systema;c uncertainty.

Procedure: MaKhew Jones (Notetaker)
To calculate k for our spring, we can derive its value the following equa;ons.
6 𝐹 = 𝑚𝑎 , 𝑚𝑎 = 0
6 𝐹 = 𝐹+ − 𝐹,
𝐹+ = 𝐹,
𝐹+ = 𝑘𝑥 (𝐻𝑜𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑠 𝐿𝑎𝑤), 𝐹, = 𝑚𝑔
𝑘𝑥 = 𝑚𝑔
𝑚𝑔
𝑘=
∆𝑥
These equa;ons eventually yield 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛, ∙ 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 on the ver;cal axis and
𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 on the horizontal axis. Unfortunately, the CBR can’t tell us ∆𝑥 automa;cally, but
simply by graphing 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 on the horizontal axis, the slope is the calculated k value.
The main challenge that we worked to solve was elimina;ng the systema;c uncertainty
that the CBR gave us when using its data to calculate k. To solve this, we started by calcula;ng
our own velocity values based oﬀ the CBR’s posi;on values over ;me. We used the equa;on,
∆.
𝑣 = ∆/ , to solve this. We encountered an issue with aligning the calculated veloci;es with their
corresponding t values, as the calculated veloci;es are somewhere in between the two t values
used to calculate them. To work around this, we used x and t values on either side of one
speciﬁc t value, and assigned the calculated v to the speciﬁc t. With the same methodology, we
∆0
calculated accelera;on, 𝑎 = ∆/ , with these veloci;es, and created the graph, 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛123 ,
pictured below as Figure 1. This calculated k value was 22.8, which was more accurate, but s;ll
contained a large systema;c error (the spring’s manufacturer stated k value is 25 ± 10%).
Then, we were given a sine curve,
𝑥+451 (𝑡) = 𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑒 ∙ sin(2𝜋 ∙ 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 ∙ 𝑡 + 𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒) + 𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑡, to ﬁt our data to.
This would allow us to ﬁt a graph to the accelera;on values the CBR was returning, elimina;ng
the rough parts of the CBR’s accelera;on graph. However, we needed this equa;on to calculate
accelera;on, not posi;on, so we took two deriva;ves of it, to yield 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛126 (𝑡) =
−4 ∙ 𝜋 3 ∙ 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 3 ∙ 𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑒 ∙ sin(2𝜋 ∙ 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 ∙ 𝑡 + 𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒) + 𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑡. Upon
graphing this equa;on, the data returned a k value of 24.57. (Figure 3), the most accurate that
we had seen. Nevertheless, we needed to take many data samples to ensure that we were
certain which equa;on 𝐶𝐵𝑅7 𝑠 𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛, 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛123 , 𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛126 - was in fact the most
accurate and precise. To do this, we took ﬁve samples of control data to calculate the standard
devia;ons of every graphing method. These standard devia;ons would be the control group
random uncertainty. We also wanted to see if changing seZngs on the CBR would induce a
change in the random uncertainty. This would tell us which had the least systema;c uncertainty,
because if the random uncertainty didn’t change through the adjustment of experiment
seZngs, then it was more accurate. As seen in Figure 5, the calculated k values from the CBR
and 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛123 have a much larger systema;c uncertainty throughout the various trials,
whereas 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛126 stays consistent throughout the varying trials. This means that
𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛126 is in fact the most accurate and precise.

The summary of relevant results from our lab can be seen in this data table below which
displays the CBR Equa;on 2 and Equa;on 5 calculated k values at diﬀerent sample rates.
Calculated K values vs Sample rate

This chart helps show how the diﬀerent methods of calcula;ng the k value change based on
sample rate. This trend can be more easily seen in the graph of this below

This chart helps between show the diﬀerence between the methods of calcula;ng k values. The
blue line shows the CB calculated k values which has a very high standard devia;on of about +/5.259 as the values vary greatly as the sample rate changes. These values appears to be more
accurate as the sample rate increases. The yellow line represents equa;on 2s calculated k
values based on sample rate. These values also have a large standard devia;on of about +/2.902 however it varies less than that of the CBR calculated k value but follows a very similar
trend to the CBR values as they both appear to become more accurate as the sample rate
increases. The green lines displays the equa;on 5 calculated k values which have a signiﬁcantly

lower standard devia;on of about +/-0.178. These values appear to vary much less and remain
around the same value despite sample rate as these values do not follow the same trend as
equa;on 2 and CBR calculated k values These equa;on 5 K values appear to niot vary based on
sample rate and appear to be the overall most accurate as they have a very low standard
devia;on.
Some relevant code that helped produce these values and graphs was that the CBR data was
plugged into the code and the CBR k value was calculated using the code below

This set of code above essen;ally directly takes the posi;on and accelera;on data collected by
the CBR and plots a graph with x values as posi;on and y values as accelera;on ;mes mass
which gives a slope that equals the k value. This slope was taken for each set of data and used
above in the analysis of the CBR Calculated k value.

This next set of code above was used to calculate the equa;on 2 K value. This code also uses the
method of ploZng the posi;on as x values and accelera;on ;mes mass as the y values and
takes the slope as the k value. However the diﬀerence here is that the ﬁrst couple lines of code
recalculated the accelera;on by calcula;ng the accelera;on through the change in velocity
instead of directly by the CBRs data. This was used to calculate the equa;on 2 k values for the
data above.

This code was used to calculate the equa;on 5 k value. This code also uses the method of
ploZng the posi;on as x values and accelera;on ;mes mass as the y values and takes the slope
as the k value. However it recalculated the accelera;on by essen;ally ﬁZng a sine func;on top
the accelera;on data made from equa;on 2 this essen;ally aKempted to ﬁll in gaps of the data
as inn theory the accelera;on should be periodic and follow a nice sine func;on however based
oﬀ systema;c error the data might not show this. This code and equa;on essen;ally try to the
ﬁll the gaps and show what ideally the accelera;on should have been based on the data we
had. This method was used to calculate the k value for the equa;on 5 calculated k values above
Conclusion: Sam Jordan (R)
Figure one consists of CBR original data, which is how posi;on changes over ;me, as well as the
data calculated from equa;on 2, which is how accelera;on changes over ;me. The data that
was retrieved from the CBR machine was neither precise nor accurate, which led us to calculate
further data using equa;on 2. The k constant value can be determined by using the slope of the
trendline in ﬁgure one, which is 22.80. Because the CBR data does not provide a consistent k
constant value, it can be said that there is systema;c error present, due to the fact that there is
an assumed 20% error with the CBR machine. While equa;on 2 provides a more precise and
more accurate k constant value, it does not eliminate the greatest percentage of systema;c
error. PUT IN NUMBERS
Figure two compares both the calculated CBR accelera;on and the calculated equa;on 2
accelera;on. The given k constant value for the spring is 25, +- 10%. When looking at the graph
in ﬁgure two, it can be seen that the amplitude of the calculated CBR accelera;on wave is less
than the amplitude of the calculated equa;on 2 accelera;on. Our average k constant value
based on the CBR machine is 19.197 and our average k constant value based on equa;on 2 is
22.808. Because the value from equa;on 2 is closer to the given 25, this proves that it is more
accurate and precise than the CBR machine.
Because there was s;ll room for greater accuracy, equa;on 5 was created and tested in order to
determine if the data provided from equa;on 5 trials proved to be more accurate and more
precise than the rest of the data. Figure three consists of the CBR machine data and the
calculated equa;on 5 data, which is also accelera;on changing over ;me. The graph in ﬁgure
three compares the posi;on calculated from the cbr to the accelera;on x mass calculated from
equa;on 5. The k constant value can be determined from the slope of the trendline, which is
24.57. This shows us that equa;on 5 provides the closest k constant value to the given 25,
which would lead us to believe that equa;on 5 eliminates the greatest amount of systema;c
error.

Figure four compares the waves of all three procedures, CBR machine, equa;on 2, and equa;on
5. When looking at this graph, it can be seen that the wave for equa;on 5 is the smoothest and
does not contain any spikes. It holds a constant interval on the y-axis. Comparing this wave to
the equa;on 2 wave (orange), the wave for equa;on 2 contains numerous spikes throughout.
Because of this, we are led to believe that this provides the most consistent set of numbers for
the k constant value, the average being 24.575.
When looking at ﬁgure ﬁve, it can be seen that all three trendlines agree with the data because
they pass through the provided error bars. This graph contains the calculated k constant value
for the CBR machine, equa;on2, and equa;on 5. The standard devia;on and k constant value
for the CBR machine is 19.196 +/- 5.260. The standard devia;on and k constant value for
equa;on 2 is 22.808 +/- 2.902. The standard devia;on and k constant value for equa;on 5 is
24.575 +/- 0.178. Based on all of these values, with the standard devia;on for equa;on 5 being
the lowest and smallest number and closest k constant value to 25, it can be said that equa;on
5 provides the most accurate and precise way of acquiring the k constant value.
To conclude, based on all ﬁve of our graphs and our calculated k constant values, equa;on 5
yields the least amount of systema;c error. By changing the sampling time of the CBR, the CBR
calculated K changes drastically compared to equation 5. This is because equation 5 takes
away more of the systematic uncertainty automatically, so an adjustment in sampling time
doesn't induce a larger random uncertainty. Equation 2 is a mix of the CBR and equation 5,
because its K changes less over time, but still does change according to the increased sampling
time. Our final K value is calculated based off equation 5 and the control data group: 25.101 +/0.078 for the red spring.
