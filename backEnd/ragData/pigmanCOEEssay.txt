Education, College, Graduate-school
During the University of Kentucky’s First Year Engineering program, the curriculum
constantly pushes itself to ask students one question. What does it mean to be an engineer? The
answer to this question varies from one student’s perspective to another, but to me, there is a
clear-cut definition. When an individual has the capacity for creating a solution to a problem and
acts upon that ability induce positive change, they are an engineer. In this sense, I still consider
myself to be an engineer, but in a different lense. After completing my undergraduate Computer
Science Degree, I am seeking to go to graduate school where I will specialize in AI policy. Our world
is hurtling into a future full of unknowns surrounding AI and the future of technology, and prior
to full implementation of AI in people’s daily lives, trained professionals need to already have
written adequate legislation surrounding it. To that end, I am studying towards the goal of being
an AI Policy Advisor for congresspeople to write legislation that prepares us for threats and
complications dealing with the technology sector.
There are a multitude of factors that have influenced me to pursue this career, none being
more important than my family. Growing up my father bounced around the tech industry from
cybersecurity to telecommunications, and I was naturally inclined to learn more about
computers. However, it would take more than just an inclination towards computers for me to
decide to go to graduate school. In fact, it was while I was writing my college essays in my senior
year of high school that I really started to identify where I wanted to orient my studies.
Naturally being a leader, I have captained my Cross Country and Track team
down to State, taken point on group projects, and loved coaching all my life. The elation that can
be felt by a group of peers that just overcame a monumental task is that of the purest joy, and to
be the one that lead them there yields an even greater feeling. Therefore, this love of leadership is
what has led me to pursue a career on the very cutting edge. As college essays demanded I start
figuring out my next steps, I started brainstorming career paths that would combine leading a
team with my cultivated love of technology. Likewise, I have never wanted to have a mundane
job, and so the idea of advising policy for one of my generations greatest challenges became my
obsession. I began learning all I could on AI, and at Kentucky I have attended UK’s
Computational Sciences Summit on AI, spoken with lawyers in the field, and researched
technology legislation on my own. However, none of these opportunities bear the funds
necessary for seven years of higher education, and it is for this reason that I should be the
recipient of this scholarship.
