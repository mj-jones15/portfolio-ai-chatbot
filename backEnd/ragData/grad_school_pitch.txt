College, Graduate-School, AI-Policy
I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence following the completion of my undergraduate degree at the University of Kentucky, with the goal of becoming an AI Policy Researcher or Advisor. I am particularly interested in programs with a strong interdisciplinary foundation, as my research interests lie at the intersection of AI, technology, political science, and philosophy. I am currently targeting approximately 13 programs, including Carnegie Mellon, the University of Maryland, Duke, and Johns Hopkins, among others.
