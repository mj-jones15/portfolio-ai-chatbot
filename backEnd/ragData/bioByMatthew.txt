About-me, Bios

The purpose of this document is to provide a summary of the various different documents found here and some more context about my life. I attended William Fremd High School where I ran cross country and track for most of my time. I also played on the Fremd Baseball team my freshman year. In cross country I was an all state academic and All conference athlete. In track, I qualified for the state meet with my relay teams in the 4x800 and 4x400, and my 4x800 won first place in the Illinois indoor state championships. I also participated in choir all four years of high school. I started singing in elementary school with voice lessons and participating in my church's youth choir in middle school. In high school I was selected for the regional choir twice. Now in University, I attend the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky. My major is in Computer Science with minors in mathematics and vocal performance, and I am pursuing a certificate in artificial intelligence. I also just finished a study abroad semester in Bilbao, Spain, where I attended Universidad de Deusto. For activities in College, I am a member and the social media chair of the University's all male a cappella group, the acoUstiKats. I am also a member of the UK Men's Chorus, and the treasurer of the Kentucky Alpha Chapter of Tau Beta Pi. I am currently a junior in college, but my goals post grad are to proceed directly into a Ph.D. program to study AI the policy surrounding it. I am primarily targeting graduate programs in computer science with supplemental advanced technology policy work. This is all to support my goal of being an AI public policy advisor. 

When I was younger I played lots of sports. I played travel baseball from 3rd grade until 8th grade, and participated in travel and park district basketball, flag football, soccer, cross country, and track.
