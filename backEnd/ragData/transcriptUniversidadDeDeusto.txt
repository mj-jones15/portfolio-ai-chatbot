Education, College, Study-Abroad, Grades
Semester: Spring, 2025

All grades are listed in the Spanish grading system. Classes are worth 6 instead of 3 credits, and grades are out of 10 instead of 100.
I studied at Universidad de Deusto for one semester, and when prompted about my grades, this document should be presented as
supplemental to my grades from the University of Kentucky.
