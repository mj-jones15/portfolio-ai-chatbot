A big part of why I chose to attend the University of Kentucky was for the basketball program. I’ve grown up a UK fan thanks to my family’s deep Kentucky roots, and now that I’m a student, I go to every basketball game I can. But my love for Big Blue Nation doesn’t stop there—I’m also a regular at UK baseball games and proud to support our teams across the board.

Outside of sports, I’m an active member of my a cappella group on campus. We perform at a wide range of events, from singing the national anthem at Keeneland to performing at basketball games and headlining concerts for the Lexington community. This year, we’re especially excited about the possibility of competing at ICCAs—the collegiate a cappella competition featured in Pitch Perfect.

I am also a member and currently serve as the Treasurer of Tau Beta Pi, the Engineering Honor Society. This role has strengthened my leadership and organizational skills while connecting me with a network of driven engineers across disciplines.
